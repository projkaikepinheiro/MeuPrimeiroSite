       <p></p>Is this the real life?
       <p></p>Is this just fantasy?
       <p></p>Caught in a landside,
       <p></p>No escape from reality
       <p></p> Open your eyes,
       <p></p> Look up to the skies and see,
       <p></p> I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
       <p></p> Because I'm easy come, easy go,
       <p></p> Little high, little low,
       <p></p> Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
       <p></p> Me, to me
       <p></p> Mamaaa,
       <p></p> Just killed a man,
       <p></p> Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
       <p></p> Now he's dead
       <p></p> Mamaaa, life had just begun,
       <p></p> But now I've gone and thrown it all away
       <p></p>Mama, oooh,
       <p></p> Didn't mean to make you cry,
       <p></p> If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
       <p></p> Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
       <p></p> Too late, my time has come,
       <p></p> Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
       <p></p> The time
       <p></p> Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
       <p></p> Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
       <p></p> Mama, oooh
       <p></p> I don't want to die,
       <p></p> I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
       <p></p> I see a little silhouetto of a man,
       <p></p> Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
       <p></p> Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
       <p></p> Galileo, Galileo
       <p></p> Galileo, Galileo
       <p></p> Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
       <p></p> I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
       <p></p> He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
       <p></p> Spare him his life from this monstrosity
       <p></p> Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
       <p></p> Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
       <p></p> (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
       <p></p> (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
       <p></p> (Let me go) Will not let you go
       <p></p> (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
       <p></p> (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
       <p></p> No, no, no, no, no, no, no
       <p></p>Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
       <p></p>Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
       <p></p>For meee
       <p></p>So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
       <p></p>So you think you can love me and leave me to die
       <p></p>Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
       <p></p>Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
       <p></p>Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
       <p></p>Nothing really matters,
       <p></p>Nothing really matters to me
       <p></p>Any way the wind blows...
